# my-repo
- first connect the local git with the github repo`
- after git push -u origin main command, try just use git push.
- YES! It works, no need to add "-u origin main" again
- delete the github branch, but keep the local branch, checkout what will happen after git push!
- there is no need to create GitHub branch online, because "git push -u origin test-branch" will create the GitHub branch with the same name as local branch if there's no such GitHub branch
